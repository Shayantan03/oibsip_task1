Even though its name suggests it is a temple dedicated to the Mother Goddess Durga, the name actually alludes to ‘Durg’ which means protector or a fortress. It does feature a Durga sculpture but is dedicated mainly to both Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva , equal representatives of the holy trinity of Hinduism, along with Lord Brahma . Numerous images of Shiva and Vishnu can be found in the temple and it is a brilliant tribute to the religious and spiritual life of Karnataka. This impeccably maintained temple complex is under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India and is also in the pending list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is a popular pilgrim and tourist center attracting scores of visitors from all four corners of the Globe.</p><span class="One"><a href="https://www.astroved.com/astropedia/en/temples/south-india/durga-temple-aihole" target="_blank" class="Explore_Read_More">Read More</a></span></td>
